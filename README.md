# SocialMedia_Sentiment_Analysis

### Data resource
Since we wanted to use twitter api to get data updated initially, but it is not free to got fresh comments freely, we use ____ to crawl historic data for our new feature input resource. We use a tool called "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer" to generate lables of comments in twitter, thus fit it into supervised learning.
